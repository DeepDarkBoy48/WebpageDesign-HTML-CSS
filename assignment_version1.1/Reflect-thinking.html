              Reflective writing is a type of writing with a personal nature. It expresses personal feelings, insights
              and lessons
              learned by thinking deeply and reviewing particular experiences or events.

              <h2>Introduction</h2>
              <p>
                During the course of this module. Firstly I learned the methodology of computational thinking, then I
                learned basic
                JavaScript programming, and I also learned how to fulfill content and layout web pages using HTML and
                CSS. Through this
                knowledge, I completed a group assignment and an individual assignment.

              <h2>Learn from group task</h2>
              <p>
                For our group assignment, we were asked to work together to create a website. I had several meetings
                with my group
                members. <br><br> <b style="color:#797ef9 ;">Firstly,</b> we used the methodology of computational
                thinking to decompose a complex
                problem into
                multiple simple
                sub-problems, namely, to decompose the whole website into three parts: head, body, and footer. Each two
                people would
                complete one of the parts. <br><br><b style="color:#797ef9 ;">Secondly,</b> we abstract the emphasis of
                the whole project, namely, lay out the
                page first, and
                then fill the text content. <br><br><b style="color:#797ef9 ;">Third</b> is pattern recognition. In this
                project, there are many duplicated
                areas that can use
                the same layout. <br><br><b style="color:#797ef9 ;">Finally</b> we used some basic algorithms to
                categorize the content of each box and then
                layout it on
                different boards.
                <br><br>Throughout the process, we encountered a lot of difficulties, the most difficult part was the
                CSS
                layout, due to the
                lack of web layout experience, we studied some tutorials on YouTube and mimicked some GitHub projects,
                and finally
                learned and used Flexbox and float layout methods. During the classroom demonstration, our product was
                displayed
                successfully, but there was still a shortage, which was that when the page was zoomed in or zoomed out,
                the whole layout
                would be incorrectly organized.

              <h2>Learn from individual task</h2>
              <p>
                As I did more studying, I completed the individual task, which was the three web pages now shown. I
                still analyzed the
                project solution using a similar computational thinking methodology as in the group task. However,
                unlike the group
                task, I was required to create the head, body and footer of the web pages by myself and there was a more
                demanding
                requirement for the Text content in the HTML. Two of the difficult parts are as follows: <br><br><b
                  style="color:#797ef9 ;">1.CSS:</b> I used
                flexbox and float
                for layout, and adjusted the distance between each box by using margin and padding, and finally
                decorated it with
                background image, text color and border color. <br><br> <b style="color:#797ef9 ;">2.HTML:</b> text
                content.
                In the first part, I fully
                investigated the role of
                computational thinking, and I realized that this methodology is based on the power of computer chips.
                Whereas the
                traditional solution can only be calculated by the human brain, due to the lack of computing power,
                resulting in only a
                small number of iterations to solve the problem. And it can only solve problems with low complexity and
                cannot solve
                NP-hard problems. So computers allow us to use a brand new methodology of computational thinking. The
                second part
                introduced celebrity, I fully researched Tim Berners Lee and learned that the World Wide Web has changed
                the way of
                sharing and acquiring knowledge. The third part is the content of this page.

              <h2>Conclusion</h2>
              <p>
                After completing this module, I was impressed with the disadvantages and advantages of teamwork and
                individual tasks.
                Great teamwork reduces the workload significantly, but at the same time, the allocation of tasks also
                costs time and
                energy. Individual task requires more work, but it makes me learn more CSS, HTML knowledge and improves
                my self-learning
                ability. And after learning the computational thinking, I realized that this methodology can combine
                computers with
                different majors to solve the problems of different areas, which greatly improves the efficiency.
