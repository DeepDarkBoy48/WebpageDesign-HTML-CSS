              Tim Berners Lee was a talented computer scientist who contributed a lot to the field of computer science
              and invented
              the World Wide Web, which is known to everyone. He will be introduced below in terms of both his biography
              and his
              contributions to the field of computer science.

              <h2>Biography</h2>
              <p>
                Tim Berners was born in 1955 in London, England, and entered Oxford University in 1976 to study
                physics. In 1989, while
                working at the European Center for Nuclear Research (CERN), he came up with the idea of the World Wide
                Web, and so he
                wrote the first World Wide Web server and client. Between 1991 and 1993, he
                continued to test and
                modify the design of the World Wide Web, and developed the standards of the HyperText Markup
                Language (HTML),
                Uniform Resource Identifier (URI), and Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) (Tim Berners-Lee. 2023). These
                standards
                are still widely used today.In 1994, Tim founded the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) at the
                Massachusetts Institute of
                Technology (MIT), an organization formed to standardize the protocols and standards of the World Wide
                Web <a href="#reference4">(Berners-Lee et al. 1994)</a>. In 2016, Tim
                received the Turing Award.

              <h2>Evaluation</h2>
              <p>
                Overall, the World Wide Web is a very important part of computer science, it is a brand new way of
                communicating and
                sharing information, people can upload and share their own knowledge through the World Wide Web, and
                they can also
                access other people's knowledge, which is obviously much more efficient than obtaining information from
                traditional
                libraries. Berners-Lee undoubtedly contributed to the popularization of the Internet and profoundly
                influenced the way
                people acquired knowledge. At the same time, Berners-Lee also developed standards for HTTP, URI, and
                Html, making the
                World Wide Web more easily to develop and maintain.

              <h3 style="color: #54d062;">1. World Wide Web</h3>
              <p>
                In 1990, Tim invented the World Wide Web <a href="#reference5">(Berners-Lee 1999)</a> , before the World
                Wide Web, the way people accessed knowledge
                was single and
                inefficient, for example, to read a book, you had to read the whole book to know the whole content, but
                the World Wide
                Web introduced hypertext links to connect all the knowledge together by clicking on the links to access
                the web pages.
                In this way, knowledge distribution and access is totally changed, and people can quickly find effective
                content and
                ignore unnecessary content.
              </p>
              <h3 style="color: #54d062;">2. HTTP</h3>
              <p>
                Tim et al. also designed Internet standard tracking protocol(HTTP) for the Internet
                community<a href="#reference6">(Nielsen etal., 1999)</a>, which defines the rules for transferring
                information between a client
                and a server.
              </p>
              <h3 style="color: #54d062;">3. URI</h3>
              <p>
                Tim et al. have developed a standard for Uniform Resource Identifier (URI)
                <a href="#reference7">(Berners-Lee et al. 2005)</a> that can help
                people locate resources in the Internet.
              <h3 style="color: #54d062;">4. HTML</h3>
              <p>
                Tim was one of the creator of HTML, which is used to define the structure and content of web pages.
