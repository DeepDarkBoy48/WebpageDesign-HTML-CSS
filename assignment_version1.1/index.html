              Computational thinking is a concept introduced by <b style="color: #f88d75;"><a
                  href="#reference1">Jeannette Wing (2016)</a></b>. In her article she details the
              four
              basic elements of computational thinking: decomposition, pattern recognition, abstraction, and algorithms.

                <b style="color: #f88d75;">Decomposition</b>: Breaking down a complex problem into multiple simple
                sub-problems so that it is easily manageable,
                grouping the
                sub-problems and applying different expertise to different sub-problems.
                <br><br>
                <b style="color: #f88d75;">Abstraction</b>: For each decomposed sub-problem, we need to extract the key
                information from the problem through
                abstraction and ignore
                irrelevant details. This way we can focus on the core of the problem and simplify the complexity.
                <br><br>
                <b style="color: #f88d75;">Pattern Recognition</b>: Identify the pattern of repeated recurrence in the
                problem, analyze the characteristics of the problem,
                and solve the
                problem more efficiently
                <br><br>
                <b style="color: #f88d75;">Algorithms</b>: Solve a specific problem step-by-step using defined steps.
                Mathematical ideas are also important. For
                some problems with
                high complexity, changing the structure of the algorithm or simplifying the steps of the algorithm can
                greatly optimize
                the efficiency of the algorithm.

              <p>
                Computational thinking has a very important role in modern education, as emphasized by
                <a href="#reference2">Barr and tephenson (2011)</a>, the
                role of computational thinking in K-12 education cannot be ignored. <a href="#reference3">Grover
                  and Pea (2013)</a>
                similarly
                emphasize this
                point. Even if a student's major is not computing and they pursue a career in medicine, law, business,
                engineering,
                etc., they should gradually move away from solving problems in the traditional way and use computational
                thinking more
                to solve problems. Computational thinking allows people in different majors to use computers to solve a
                wide variety of
                real-world problems. I studied mechanical engineering in my undergraduate program and I am
                studying
                computing in my master's program, so I can integrate the knowledge of the two disciplines. For example,
                when planning a
                path for a robotic arm or assigning workloads in an industrial assembly line, I can calculate the
                optimal path for the
                movement of the robotic arm and the optimal allocation scheme for the assembly line through the 4 steps
                in computational
                thinking. The traditional method is difficult to find the core of the problem, People can only calculate
                procedures through simple algorithms, which is very inefficient. And computational thinking
                solves this problem by using the computer's power and restructuring the thinking mode.
